# Online Retail Data Clustering with K-Means

## Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation using K-Means clustering applied to an online retail dataset. The goal is to group customers based on their purchasing behavior — including monetary value, purchase frequency, and recency — to help businesses target marketing efforts more effectively.

## Dataset
The dataset contains transactional data with features like Invoice, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, Price, Customer ID, and Country.

## Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering (Monetary, Frequency, Recency)
- K-Means Clustering for segmentation
- Visualization of clusters and analysis of customer groups

## Tools and Libraries
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to reproduce the analysis and results

## Results
The project identifies distinct customer segments that can be used for targeted marketing campaigns and improving customer relationship management.
